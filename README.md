# QLeksii

## What does QLeksii do?

QLeksii is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for GraphQL to help engineers by generating different types of queries based on the collections and tables from the database URL provided by the user. The utilization of GraphQL technology provides the user with a more granular and more efficient way of accessing database information. QLeksii will provide all the information extracted from the database and dynamically generate different query types based on that information for the user. This process eliminates the need to create queries manually, which means less time consumption, and reduced costs.

# How does it work?

## Accessing the database

Once the user provides the database URL, the application will handle all the work for you. It will first mutate the link provided into something the server recognizes, then the server will do its job to retrieve all the information from the database. Once all the information is extracted, the application will dynamically create cards for each table in the database including the type of data of each entry, which will be shown in the application.

## Generating different types of queries

By clicking on the button on the upper right corner the user will access the sidebar which stores different types of queries. The user will have the option to select their preferred type of query, and the application will show all the generated queries based on the user input and selection.

## Accessing GraphiQL via Sandbox button

Alongside the tabs for the queries, the user can also use a "sandbox", where it will pop up a new window for the user to utilize the queries generated by the application, using the GraphiQL interface.

## Current Features:

-   Visualization of the collections and tables extracted from the database, including their data types
-   Dynamically generate different types queries based on user preference
-   Allows the user to utilize the generated queries by providing a "sandbox", where the user can freely interact with the database

## Additional Features to be added:

- Integration with SQL Databases
- Export generated GraphQL queries for the user to use as they wish
